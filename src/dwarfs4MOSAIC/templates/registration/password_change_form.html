    IMPORTANT

    This file implements the 'change password' functionality.
    It was working correctly in July 2025, but the feature was disabled.
    The code is retained in case it is decided to enable it in the future.
    To do so, delete {% comment %} and {% endcomment %}

<!--
  This template customizes the "Change password" page in the Django admin interface.
  It extends the default admin base template and overrides the title, breadcrumbs,
  and main content block. A button is provided to return to the main site, and
  the form for changing the user's password is rendered using Django's default form styling.
