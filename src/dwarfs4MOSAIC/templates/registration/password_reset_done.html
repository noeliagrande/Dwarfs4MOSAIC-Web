    IMPORTANT

    This file implements the 'reset password' functionality.
    It was working correctly in July 2025, but the feature was disabled.
    The code is retained in case it is decided to enable it in the future.
    To do so, delete {% comment %} and {% endcomment %}

<!--
This template extends the Django admin base layout and provides
a confirmation page shown after a password reset email is sent.
It informs the user that instructions for resetting their password
have been emailed and offers a button to return to the main site.
