    IMPORTANT

    This file implements the 'reset password' functionality.
    It was working correctly in July 2025, but the feature was disabled.
    The code is retained in case it is decided to enable it in the future.
    To do so, delete {% comment %} and {% endcomment %}

<!--
This template extends the default Django admin base template to provide a custom
"Reset password" page for the Dwarfs4MOSAIC project.

It overrides the title, breadcrumb navigation, and content blocks to display a
form where users can enter their email address to request a password reset link.
