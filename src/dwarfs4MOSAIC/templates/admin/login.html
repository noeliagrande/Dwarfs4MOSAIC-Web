    IMPORTANT

    This file implements the 'change password' functionality.
    It was working correctly in July 2025, but the feature was disabled.
    The code is retained in case it is decided to enable it in the future.

  Template override for the Django admin login page.

  This file extends the default 'admin/login.html' template and adds
  a centered link below the login form that allows users to reset their password.

  It uses the { url 'password_reset' } tag to dynamically generate the URL
  for the password reset view, and { trans } for internationalization.
